# BitWhite Photon
BitWhite is an efficient, flexible, and safe decentralized application platform designed to provide effortless development of decentralized applications. The root implementation was written in JavaScript. But in the future we plan to launch BTW on Golang and leave JS as an additional implementation.

A photon is a new era for our community. We plan to fundamentally change the protocol in order for the network to expand the transaction speed as the number of nodes increases and also change the programming language to GO.

### Why GO?
It is difficult to find a language that would be both fast and simple enough for DAPP developers. Golang is the best option, because it runs tens of times faster than JavaScript and was developed by Google for its not very experienced programmers. Go is good not only with a rich set of built-in libraries, but also by imposing a single style and recommendations for good code, just read about gofmt.


## Contribution
You can also participate in writing go-btw, for this you need to get acquainted with the main [repository](https://github.com/BTWhite/BTWChain) and create their own pull requests. To achieve consensus, do not forget to make commits in a separate branch from the master. We will be happy if someone from the community will participate in the development.
